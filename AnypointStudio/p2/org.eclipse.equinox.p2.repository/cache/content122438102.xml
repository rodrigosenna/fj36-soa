No provision of any purchase order or in any other business form employed by you will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document issued by a party hereto relating to this Agreement shall be for administrative purposes only and shall have no legal effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have entered into a separate written license agreement signed by MuleSoft for use of the Software, the terms and conditions of such other agreement shall prevail over any conflicting terms or conditions in this Agreement.&#xA;       11.8 Independent Contractors.&#xA;       The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors.

Confidential Information.&#xA;&#xA;Any software, documentation or technical information provided by MuleSoft (or its agents) shall be deemed &quot;MuleSoft Confidential Information&quot; without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, you will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any MuleSoft Confidential Information.

Export Compliance.&#xA;&#xA;You acknowledge that the Software is subject to export restrictions by the United States government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments. You shall not, and shall not allow any third-party to, remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Software or any direct product thereof:&#xA;(i) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country;&#xA;(ii) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department&apos;s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department&apos;s list of Specially Designated Nationals;&#xA;(iii) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority. You agree to the foregoing and warrant that you are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list.

General.&#xA;11.1 Assignment.&#xA;This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party&apos;s permitted successors and assigns. MuleSoft may assign this Agreement to any affiliate or in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of MuleSoft&apos;s assets or voting securities. You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, without MuleSoft&apos;s written consent. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement without such written consent will be null and void.&#xA;11.2 Severability.&#xA;If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in effect.&#xA;11.3 Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue.&#xA;This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the California state and United States federal courts located in San Francisco, California, and both parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.&#xA;11.4 Attorneys&apos; Fees and Costs.&#xA;The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its attorneys&apos; fees and costs in connection with such action.&#xA;11.5 Notices and Reports.&#xA;Any notice or report hereunder shall be in writing.

No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.&#xA;11.7 Entire Agreement.&#xA;This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No provision of any purchase order or in any other business form employed by you will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document issued by a party hereto relating to this Agreement shall be for administrative purposes only and shall have no legal effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have entered into a separate written license agreement signed by MuleSoft for use of the Software, the terms and conditions of such other agreement shall prevail over any conflicting terms or conditions in this Agreement.&#xA;11.8 Independent Contractors.&#xA;The parties to this Agreement are independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the other or incur obligations on the other party&apos;s behalf without the other party&apos;s prior written consent.&#xA;11.9 Force Majeure.&#xA;Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events, which occur after the signing of this Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control of the parties, such as strikes, blockade, war, terrorism, riots, natural disasters, refusal of license by the government or other governmental agencies, in so far as such an event prevents or delays the affected party from fulfilling its obligations and such party is not able to prevent or remove the force majeure at reasonable cost.&#xA;11.10 Government End-Users.&#xA;The Software is commercial computer software. If the user or licensee of the Software is an agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Software, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by a license agreement or by the terms of this Agreement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes.
